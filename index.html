                            harder to keep it on her face every second of her life. Her long beautiful hair, oh man, when she lets them loose, it reminds me of freedom, as long as shes with me, she can do whatever she wants and I will support her decisions. Her bindi, when she puts that bindi on in 
                            the mornings, it just looks so beautiful on her, I love it! Her voice, when she says "baby" or call to me, it just hits very different, it feels like I belong, I belong to her. And her as a whole, she is perfect ;). I love you.

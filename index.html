                        <p>This is her sleeping, not trying to be dramatic, but I would give my life for her without hesitation. This is when I realized that I have something, I have someone who I can trust and love without limits. This person is who I need to keep safe, and that is what I will do, keep her safe and the happiest I can.</p>

                        <p>This is her. I will never get enough of her, I always look forward to waking up next to her. Her smile, that smile is beyond heavenly, it makes me want to do better and work
                            harder to keep it on her face every second of her life. Her long beautiful hair, oh man, when she lets them loose, it reminds me of freedom, as long as shes with me, she can do whatever she wants and I will support her decisions. Her bindi, when she puts that bindi on in 
                            the mornings, it just looks so beautiful on her, I love it! Her voice, when she says "baby" or call to me, it just hits very different, it feels like I belong, I belong to her. And her as a whole, she is perfect ;). I love you.

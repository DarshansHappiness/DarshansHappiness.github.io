                            harder to keep it on her face every second of her life. Her long beautiful hair, oh man, when she lets them loose, it reminds me of freedom, as long as shes with me, she can do whatever she wants and I will support her decisions. Her bindi, when she puts that bindi on in 
                            the mornings, it just looks so beautiful on her, I love it! Her voice, when she says "baby" or call to me, it just hits very different, it feels like I belong, I belong to her. And her as a whole, she is perfect ;). I love you.

                        <p>Lied again about school volunteering to come to my house. It was a a really really good day. She came to meet my parents again. We had a nerf gun battle in the house, her and my brother ganged up on me -_-.
                            We took some polaroid pictures (click on title and picture to see). We also had a race, she was so confident that she would beat me and that shes faster than me, yeah no, gotchooo ass. We also made a tik tok at a rest area, that was amazing. We were both really happy this day. </p>

                        <p>WOW, JUST WOW! I don't know where to begin about this day. This is by far the best day I have ever had, never been happier, and that too witht he love of my life.
                            I picked her up, we went to get crepes, we ate Ice-Cream for breakfast üòé. We also opened gifts, we think so much alike, I gifted her the website and she gifted me 
                            a book of everything we have done so far, SO SIMILAR. We then went bowling, I was named pulpo and she was poonga, I obv let her win you knowwwwww. Yes I lost. We then went
                            to a thai resturant, we got pad thai and our dumplings had hair -_-. Shawty then drove us to the cinema and we watched Tom and Jerry movie. We then made a tik-tok which blew up. I then dropped her off to her school. 
                            BUT THE BEST DAY EVER, she was happy, I was happy, we were both smiling. Just amazing day, and we both loved it, truly wonderful. I love you Abirami. (Click picture for the BEST GIFT EVER!!)
